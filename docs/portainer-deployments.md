# What is Portainer

[Portainer](https://portainer.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) tool that lets users set-up, configure, and govern a container management portal that helps them get more value from Kubernetes sooner, with the skills the team already has. It also does the continuous deployment and delivery into Kubernetes and unorchestrated Docker, using the GitOps approach.

Manage any orchestrator, in the cloud, on prem, or at the edge, in a single interface.
